## 💌 Invitation Letter

As campus life continues to evolve, the need for a fast, transparent, and efficient canteen service becomes increasingly important. We recognize that both customers and canteen operators require a system that simplifies food ordering, payment processing, menu management, and administrative control.

To address this need, we introduce BCC Canteen, a digital platform designed to transform how campus canteens operate. This system aims to provide a seamless food ordering and payment experience for users, efficient menu and order management for canteen owners, and centralized supervision for administrators.

## **⭐** Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

As the initial development phase of BCC Canteen, the system must support the following minimum features:

- New users can register an account ✔️
- Users can log in to the system ✔️
- Users can edit their profile information ✔️
- Users can view available canteens and food menus ✔️
- Users can place food orders (only if stock is available) ✔️
- Users can make payments for their orders ✔️
- Users can view order status of their orders ✔️
- Users can leave feedback or reviews for completed orders ✔️
- Canteen owners can create, update, and delete food menus including stock ✔️
- Canteen owners can view incoming orders ✔️
- Canteen owners can view payment status of orders (e.g., Unpaid, Paid) ✔️
- Canteen owners can update order status (e.g., Waiting, Cooking, Ready, Completed) ✔️
- Canteen owners can remove inappropriate user feedback ✔️
- Admin can add new canteen owner accounts ✔️
- Admin can edit canteen owner accounts ✔️
- Admin can remove user or canteen owner accounts ✔️
